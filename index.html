        <p class="story-text">
          Before learning the intricacies of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language),
          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript, it is important that you
          gain a solid understanding of the technologies that help transform
          these plaintext files to the rich multimedia displays you see on your
          computer or handheld device when browsing the World Wide Web. For
          example, a file containing markup and client-side code HTML and CSS is
          useless without a web browser to view it, and no one besides yourself
          will see your content unless a web server is involved.
        </p>
        <p class="story-text">
          Web servers make your content available to others who, in turn, use
          their web browsers to navigate to an address and wait for the server
          to send information to them. You will be intimately involved in this
          publishing process because you must create files and then put them on
          a server to make them available in the first place, and you must
          ensure that your content will appear to the end user as you intended.

          The dogs colloquially referred to as corgis actually belong to two
          separate breeds: the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Cardigan Welsh
          Corgi. Both Welsh breeds have long histories as herders in the
          Pembrokeshire and Cardiganshire counties of Wales, respectively.
          “Corgi” actually means dwarf dog in Welsh.
        </p>
        <p class="story-text">
          Breed standards developed in the 1920s as corgis began to appear in
          dog shows and gain recognition. Before World War II, corgis of both
          varieties were rare in the United Kingdom.

        <h1 class="story-title">Student Learn HTML!</h1>
        <p class="story-text">
          Learning HTML will take practice, practice, and some more practice,
          just like any new skill. Your approach to HTML should be like your
          approach to learning a new language. Start with the understanding that
          you are beginning with no prior knowledge. It can be humbling for even
          the most experienced workers.
        </p>
        <p class="story-text">
          However, once you realize that you don't know anything about this new
          language, you can begin to dive in and discover what it is really
          about. As you learn, HTML will become more apparent to you, and you
          can continue to chip away at each lesson which will compound on one
          another.

          These boy and dog quotes are just what you need. Everyone knows that
          the bond between a boy and his dog is unbreakable and something we
          should all strive for. Dogs are loyal and love their owners very much
          and are such a great addition to the family as well. They spend their
          short little lives right by our sides, devoted to us 100%.
        </p>
        <p class="story-text">
          Owning a dog is good for the soul and soothing to the mind. They' re
          amazing creatures that can turn a bad day into a good day easily.
